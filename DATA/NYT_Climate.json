If climate change continues at its current pace through 2100, the report suggests, vineyards worldwide will be displaced by 1,000 kilometers to the north or south depending on which hemisphere they are in, and a swath of Mediterranean vineyards will be lost. The report pays particular attention to Burgundy, which has already felt the effects of a warmer climate. Around Beaune, the center of the Cote d'Or region, grapes were harvested generally 13 days earlier from 1988 to 2006 than from 1973 to 1987. Over the same period, the report states, the time it took grapes to progress from ripening to maturity dropped to 40 days from 50 days. Paradoxically, Burgundy has experienced a short-term benefit from climate change in a series of good vintages over the last 15 years. Similar benefits can be seen in other regions like Barolo, Champagne and the Mosel and Rhine. In the long term, though, the report warns of the possibility of new vine diseases, increased flooding and erosion, and the prospect of fruit rotting on the vine due to the rise in temperature and carbon dioxide. Ultimately, it suggests, Burgundy may come to resemble a Mediterranean region. French winemakers are already urging their government to push for a strong global agreement at a United Nations climate summit to be held in December in Copenhagen.","157":"Thanks so much to all of you for responding to my request two weeks ago for \u201cneglected topics\u201d for me to weigh in on this year. There were 1,300 comments that came pouring in, many with multiple ideas, and I\u2019m still thinking them through. Today\u2019s column takes off on one of the suggestions that came up regularly: climate change. It\u2019s not 100 percent neglected of course, but I think it\u2019s vastly undercovered considering the scale of the issues. So read the column and share your thoughts below.","158":"Bill Clinton talked to Andrew C. Revkin after announcing his new plan to fight climate change at the Large Cities Climate Summit in New York last May.","159":"I have a short piece going into Sunday\u2019s paper on the question of whether hurricanes are getting stronger because of climate change. In it, I outline the views of Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who takes the position that they are, and Thomas R.

Our current trajectory looks perilous.","165":"When I arranged to visit Wellston High School for a story about how the culture war over climate change was erupting in science classrooms, I had a pretty good idea of what I would find.","166":"Human-induced climate change, which certain politicians deny and many of us choose to ignore, threatens the survival of every species on Earth. If emissions continue at their current rate, scientists anticipate widespread coastal land loss, agricultural and economic collapse, food and water shortages, frequent and severe natural disasters, and unprecedented refugee crises. For the third installment of our series T Agitprop, we asked 12 contemporary artists, including Alexis Rockman, Mel Chin, Erin Jane Nelson and the members of the collective Dear Climate, to contribute works, most of them new and created exclusively for T, in response to this global emergency. Here are their pieces and statements.","167":"Perhaps now we can put the manufactured controversy known as Climategate behind us and turn to the task of actually doing something about global warming.

Representative Joe Barton, among the most reliable of the oil, gas and coal industries\u2019 many friends in Congress, complained that the commission\u2019s time would be better spent on \u201cinvestor protection\u201d rather than imposing new burdens on corporations and promoting the \u201csocial agendas\u201d of environmental groups.","173":"WHETHER in Davos or almost anywhere else that leaders are discussing the world\u2019s problems, they are missing by far the biggest issue: the rapidly deteriorating global environment and its ability to support civilization.","174":"Animal and plant species around the world may be threatened by warmer global temperatures.","175":"Wishing you had more intelligent things to say about the climate change summit in Copenhagen?

Mr. Hansen, who is also a professor at Columbia and an advisor to Al Gore, gave pioneering testimony before Congress on the threat of growing carbon emissions. He will take on the current proposals and offer a few strategies of his own to combat global warming at the event, which is presented by the Secret Science Club.","176":"After years of denial, delay, distraction and distortion, climate change is changing the political climate.","177":"COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 THIS past winter was a tough one in our backyard. Where we live, about a hundred miles inland from the South Carolina coast, winter is normally a good time to make changes, like the swath of turf I removed from our front yard this year and replaced with perennial flowers and small tufts of native grass. But what is normal now in the garden? One week I\u2019m sweating, the bees are buzzing, buds are breaking; the next, the birdbath is frozen and there\u2019s snow on the ground.  ","178":"Follow our live coverage of extreme weather and climate change.","179":"Summer camp is an idyll for millions of children each year. But climate change, which affects so many aspects of our lives, is upending the camp experience, as well. I interviewed directors of camps across the United States to ask how the warming planet is altering their little patches of paradise. These folks tend to be keen observers of the natural world (why else would you put up with camp food and mosquitoes?) and they had plenty to say.","180":"In response to my column yesterday, David Leonhardt offers two good reasons to think that climate change isn\u2019t going to be a replay of the great overpopulation and resource-scarcity debates of the 1960s and 1970s, in which optimists like Julian Simon were ultimately vindicated and doomsayers like Paul \u201cThe Population Bomb\u201d Ehrlich were proven wrong:","181":"Wonder where Rudolph W.

","183":"Stanford, Calif. \u2014 THE good news got pretty much drowned out this month: Yes, 2016 is on track to become the hottest year on record, but thankfully also the third year in a row to see relatively flat growth in global greenhouse gas emissions. With global economic growth on the order of 3 percent a year, we may well have turned a corner toward a sustainable climate economy.","184":"Clyde E. Goulden is the director of the Institute of Mongolian Biodiversity and Ecological Studies at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.","185":"A while back I wrote about anti-green economics \u2014 the insistence, by opponents of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, that the economic cost of cap-and-trade would be immense and unsupportable. I cited Robert Samuelson, who ridiculed the Environmental Defense Fund for suggesting that major action on greenhouse gases would only cost a dime a day per person.","186":"There are many signs that the world is heading into a period of warming -\u2013 one that could melt glaciers, flood small islands and coastal cities, threaten some animal species and make crops difficult to grow in previously productive agricultural regions. ","187":"After years of denial, delay, distraction and distortion, climate change is changing the political climate.","188":"To cruise or not to cruise? To safari or stay put? To fly \u2014 perchance to hang glide or kite surf into some un-Instagrammed country.
